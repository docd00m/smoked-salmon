### ‚öô New Options

#### Default Editor Configuration
New configuration option for setting your preferred text editor:
```toml
[upload]
default_editor = "nano"  # Can be set to "vim", "emacs", or any editor in PATH
```

#### Enhanced Seedbox Configuration
New seedbox configuration options for better torrent client control:
```toml
[[seedbox]]
directory = "/downloads"  # Now overrides the directory provided to torrent client
add_paused = true  # Add torrents in paused state
```
- **`add_paused`**: Control whether torrents are added in paused or active state
- **Enhanced `directory`**: Now overrides the download path provided to the torrent client, useful when the torrent client has its own path mapping configuration

#### Integrity check is now performed by default (like log check and MQA check)
- Use `--skip-integrity-check` flag to skip the integrity verification of audio files

### üìù Notes for Windows Users

SoX on Windows currently has issues with UTF-8 file paths. If you need UTF-8 path support, you can fix this using the following PowerShell commands. This fix is provided by [DevYukine](https://github.com/DevYukine) - many thanks to him!

```powershell
$soxDir = $((Get-Command sox).Source | Split-Path)
$zipPath = Join-Path -Path $soxDir -ChildPath "sox_windows_fix.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/master/.github/dependency-fixes/sox_windows_fix.zip" -OutFile $zipPath
Expand-Archive -Path $zipPath -DestinationPath $soxDir -Force
regedit "$soxDir\PreferExternalManifest.reg"
Remove-Item $zipPath
```

Enjoy SoX working with UTF-8 paths! üéâ

### üîç Metadata Sources and Connection Testing

Added **metadata sources and seedbox connection testing**:
- Use `checkconf -m` to test metadata source connections (Discogs, Tidal, Qobuz)
- Use `checkconf -s` to test seedbox connections

### üêõ Various Fixes and Improvements

- **Transcoding Path Names**: Fixed bug where MP3 transcoding output folders would add [320] or [V0] separately - now the output folder name follows the **FOLDER_TEMPLATE** configuration
- **Range Rip CRC Calculation**: Added **CRC calculation for range rip logs** - automatically detects range rip type log files and calculates CRC by concatenating individual track files
- **Upload Fix**: Fixed site_page_upload failure when uploading to existing group when only `session` is specified without `api_key`

## What's Changed
* Updates the transcoding path name generation logic to follow the FOLDER_TEMPLATE by @KyokoMiki in https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/162

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change: Torrent Client Injection

This release introduces **breaking changes** to the torrent client integration system.

### üîÑ New Seedbox Upload System

The legacy qBittorrent and ruTorrent injection modules have been replaced with a unified seedbox upload system that supports:
- **Multiple torrent clients**: qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, ruTorrent
- **Multi-device deployment**: Upload files and torrents to multiple seedboxes simultaneously

#### ‚úÖ Migration Guide

**Previous local injection is now considered a "local" seedbox**. You need to update your configuration:

1. **Remove old settings** (these are no longer supported):
   - Any qBittorrent or ruTorrent specific injection settings

2. **Add new seedbox configuration** to your `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   # Example: Local seedbox (replaces old injection)
   [[seedbox]]
   name = "local"
   enabled = true
   type = "local"
   directory = "/path/to/your/download/folder"
   torrent_client = "transmission+http://username:password@localhost:9091"
   label = "smoked-salmon"
   
   # Example: Remote seedbox via rclone
   [[seedbox]]
   name = "remote-seedbox"
   enabled = true
   type = "rclone"
   url = "nas"  # Name of remote in rclone
   directory = "/downloads"
   torrent_client = "qbittorrent+http://username:password@192.168.1.2:8080"
   flac_only = false
   extra_args = ["--checksum", "-P"]
   label = "smoked-salmon"
   ```

3. **Enable seedbox uploading**:
   ```toml
   [upload]
   upload_to_seedbox = true
   ```

### üéµ New Automatic Transcoding Feature

This release introduces **automatic transcoding and upload** functionality:
- Automatically detects all possible transcode formats after upload
- Uploads all transcoded versions automatically  
- **Lossy master report**: If source is lossy master, all transcoded torrents are automatically reported as lossy master
- **No configuration required**: Works through interactive prompts during upload

### üéØ New Tracker Support

Added support for **DICMusic** tracker. To configure:
```toml
[tracker.dic]
session = 'get-from-site-cookie'
```

### üñºÔ∏è Automatic Cover Compression

New feature to automatically compress embedded cover images in FLAC files:
```toml
[image]
auto_compress_cover = true  # Set to true to enable
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **No automatic migration** from old injection settings - manual configuration required
- The **Wiki** is currently outdated and will be updated in a future release
- **Please report** if you encounter crashes or strange behavior with these new features

## What's Changed
* Merge seedbox uploading module from smoked-salmon-oasis by @KyokoMiki in https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/118
* Merge automatic transcoding and uploading module from smoked-salmon-oasis by @KyokoMiki in https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/151

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change: Configuration File Format

This release introduces a **major breaking change**: we are transitioning away from the legacy `config.py` configuration file.

### üîÅ New Configuration System

Settings are now stored in a **TOML** file located at: `~/.config/smoked-salmon/config.toml`
There is **no automatic migration** from the old `config.py`, so you will need to manually migrate your settings.

#### ‚úÖ Recommended Migration Path

Start from the [default configuration file](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/blob/master/data/config.default.toml).  
This ensures you're aligned with the latest structure and includes all newly introduced options.

### üìñ Documentation

- The **README** has been updated to reflect this change.
- The **Wiki** is currently outdated and will be updated in a future release.

We understand this requires extra effort and appreciate your patience as we make configuration cleaner and more maintainable moving forward.

Big update from Audionut! The coolest part: you can now send torrents straight to qBittorrent using its API. No more messing with watched folders or adding them by hand.

Check `config.py.txt` for the new `QBITTORRENT_XXX` settings. With that option, if you‚Äôre using Docker, you might not need to map the `.torrents` folder anymore, just use `/app/.torrents` inside the container: torrents will be generated there and injected into qbittorrent.

## Metadata Parsing Improvements

Numerous small changes were made to improve metadata parsing accuracy.  
If you encounter any strange metadata behavior, please share feedback ‚Äî and if possible, include metadata links so we can reproduce the issue.

## What's Changed
- Update wiki installation link in `README.md` by [@digeratimt](https://github.com/digeratimt) ([#23](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/23))
- Update `oxipng` install command in `README.md` by [@digeratimt](https://github.com/digeratimt) ([#25](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/25))
- Release is now marked as 24bit if **any** file is 24bit (previously only the first file was checked)
- Improved Qobuz artist parsing (better detection of guest artists)
- More accurate Album/EP/Single classification:
  - Less than 3 tracks ‚Üí **Single**
  - Less than 5 tracks ‚Üí **EP**
  - 6 tracks with no release type ‚Üí **EP**
  - Otherwise uses metadata release type, or defaults to **Album**
- Deezer API responses now use English (mainly affects genres)
- If a source is specified for a WEB release, it takes top priority for metadata
- Removed usage of Qobuz ID as catalog number (CatNo)
- Improved regex detection of "Self-released" label
- Added `NO_GENRES_FROM_QOBUZ` option:
  - Prevents fetching localized genres from Qobuz
  - Useful for non-English accounts
  - Default: `false`

## New dependency
Oxipng is a modern replacement for OptiPNG, written in Rust and optimized for multi-core processors. It offers faster processing and better compression than OptiPNG. Smoked-salmon now utilizes Oxipng for PNG compression, achieving around a 30% reduction in file size, making it more efficient for image hosting.

You'll need to install Oxipng on your system (it's already included in the Docker image). Installation instructions can be found on the official repository: https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng.

Ubuntu/Debian users can simply run the following command (make sure to check the latest Oxipng release first, and replace the link accordingly):
```
wget https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/releases/download/v9.1.4/oxipng_9.1.4-1_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i oxipng_9.1.4-1_amd64.deb
```
Alternatively, you can still disable compression by setting `COMPRESS_SPECTRALS = False` in your `config.py` file.

## What's Changed
* Replace `optipng` by `oxipng`
* Use `process_files` (better multithreaded processing) for spectrals generation
* Fix broken log upload for CDs (broken during ruff fixes)
